    "1. Total value of the Salary Sheet -> What was the total expense on employee salaries by the company? <br>\n",
    "    Calculate the total salary for each employee, salary + benefits + taxes, then sum all salaries\n",

    "    Calculate the total invoicing for each service and then sum the invoicing of all\n",

    "3. What % of employees have already signed a contract?<br>\n",
    "    In the service base we have the employee who closed each service. But not all the employees that the company has have already closed some service.<br>\n",
    "    . In the employee base we have a list of all employees<br>\n",
    "    . We want to calculate Qty_Employees_Closed_Service / Qty_Employees_Totals<br>\n",
    "    . To calculate the number of employees who closed a service, use the service base and count how many employees there are. But remember, each employee can only be counted once.<br><br>\n",
    "    If you apply the .unique() method on a variable which is just 1 column of a dataframe, it will delete all duplicate values from that column.<br>\n",
    "    Ex: unique_columnA = dataframe['columnA'].unique() gives you as a response a list with all items in columnA appearing only once. All repeated values of columnA are excluded from the unicos_columnA variable\n",
